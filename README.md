# MyCalendar
This is a calendar application that allows users to create, edit, and remove events.

Events are automatically saved to the Documents folder in a folder called MyCalendar so that when users close and reopen the program, their events are still there.

Note: this application looks for a folder called MyCalendar in the Documents folder. The program then looks for a file called `calendar.mycal`. If this MyCalendar folder does not exist, the folder will be created. Likewise, if the folder exists but the `calendar.mycal` file does not exist, the file is created within the folder. **If you have a file named `calendar.mycal` within a folder called MyCalendar in the Documents folder, this file will be written over.
